description: 'Scope and Sequence (skōp) n. (sē’kwəns, -kwĕns’) n 1) The area covered by a given activity or subject. 1) A following of one thing after another; succession No-fluff, straightforward, and intellectually-engaging messages in 15 minutes. That’s our goal or your money back. For most of us, we come to college to get a degree to equip for a job in the real world once we graduate. Yet, why don’t we approach our faith in a similar way? The Journey wants to provide you with a holistic understanding and practice of Christianity that equips you for life in the real world after you graduate. Whether you’ve been in church since before you can remember or are just beginning to ask big spiritual questions, we’ve designed a three-year scope and sequence intended to delve into the “basics”—though you’d be surprised how deep the basics can go. In addition, a fourth capstone year where you would repeat similar material of three years ago is intended for you to lead and walk with freshman students in the very same topics and questions you had at that age. We have Q&A and discussion after every message where students can text in questions anonymously. Each semester is good enough to be a standalone theme, so don’t feel like you need to commit to three years or can’t show up in the middle of year two, semester one, week seven. You’ll still fit in fine. However, if you do stick around with us for four years (or how many it takes you to graduate), expect to feel like you came away with a second degree, only obscenely cheaper and potentially more useful.
